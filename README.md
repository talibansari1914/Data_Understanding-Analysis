# 📚 Data Understanding & Analysis Practice Library

This repository is a **hands-on data analysis practice library** focused on building strong fundamentals in **NumPy and Pandas** and **actively applying those concepts in data understanding, analysis, and visualization tasks**.

All analytical work in this repository is performed by **using NumPy and Pandas operations directly on data**, not just learning concepts in isolation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice **real data analysis workflows** using NumPy and Pandas
- Apply theoretical concepts to **actual datasets**
- Perform data understanding, cleaning, and exploratory analysis
- Use Pandas & NumPy operations to solve analytical questions
- Strengthen problem-solving and analytical thinking for industry roles

This repository represents **continuous practice and applied learning**, not a single final project.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy** – numerical computation, arrays, statistics, linear algebra
- **Pandas** – data manipulation, analysis, and dataframe operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization (used during analysis practice)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Applied Data Analysis Work

The data analysis performed in this repository **actively uses NumPy and Pandas concepts**, including:

### 🔹 NumPy Usage
- Array creation and manipulation<br>
- Vectorized operations<br>
- Statistical calculations (mean, median, std, correlation)<br>
- Conditional logic and masking<br>
- Linear algebra operations where applicable<br>

### 🔹 Pandas Usage
- Data loading and inspection<br>
- Handling missing and inconsistent values<br>
- Filtering and conditional selection<br>
- GroupBy operations and aggregations<br>
- Feature-level analysis<br>
- Data transformation and restructuring<br>

These concepts are **directly applied while analyzing datasets**, not just practiced separately.<br>

---

## 📊 Data Analysis 

During data analysis, the following tasks are performed:<br>
- Data understanding and exploratory analysis (EDA)<br>
- Price, rating, and category-based analysis<br>
- Statistical summaries and comparisons<br>
- Answering analytical and assignment-based questions<br>

All visualizations are created **after processing and analyzing data using Pandas and NumPy**.<br>

---

## 📁 Dataset Usage

- Datasets used are **public or practice datasets**<br>
- Data is used strictly for **learning and analysis practice**<br>
- Datasets may change across notebooks depending on the exercise<br>
- No fixed production dataset is maintained in this repository<br>

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Strong command over NumPy & Pandas fundamentals<br>
- Ability to apply concepts to real datasets<br>
- Structured approach to data understanding<br>
- Practical experience in exploratory data analysis<br>
- Improved analytical and problem-solving skills<br>
